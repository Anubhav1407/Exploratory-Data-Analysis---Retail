# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

# Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project based on a retail business dataset. 
The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset, gain insights, and present the findings in a clear and concise manner.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a retail business dataset, which includes information about various aspects of the business such as sales, customers, products, and transactions. 
The dataset is stored in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file format.

# Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:
1. data/: This directory contains the dataset file (SampleSuperstore.csv) used for the analysis.
2. notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for the exploratory data analysis.
3. reports/: This directory contains the final reports generated from the analysis.
4. README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and its contents.

# Getting Started
1. Install the necessary dependencies. You may use a virtual environment for this purpose.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and navigate to the notebooks directory.
3. Open the main notebook (EDA Project.ipynb) to start the analysis.
4. Execute the code cells in the notebook to perform the EDA.
5. Once the analysis is complete, the results and findings can be viewed and exported from the notebook.

# Conclusion
This project aims to explore and analyze a retail business dataset through an exploratory data analysis approach. 
By examining the dataset and extracting meaningful insights, we can gain a better understanding of the retail business and make data-driven decisions. Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and adapt it to your own needs.
